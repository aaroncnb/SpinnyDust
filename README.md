A repo containing most of the code I used to generate figures and analyses shown in my doctoral thesis, submitted to the University of Tokyo, in December 2017. The .TeX files and figures for the manuscript itself are also available. Although my PhD is finished, expect this repo to change if (when) I discover typos or try to clean up the code and directories. As of May 23rd 2018, it's organizational state reflects a rather frantic post-submission state of mind--- you have been warned!

If it helps you, use it as you like. Acknowledgements and/or citations, when appropriate, are appreciated.
