  In Ch.~\ref{ch:intro} we demonstrated the both the mysteries and potential for answers revealed by all-sky observation and analysis. A particular mystery, that of the Anomalous Microwave Emission, and the popular but yet unproven hypothesis that this \acrshort{ame} comes from rapidly spinning tiny dust grains, perhaps \acrshort{pah}s, was introduced. We explained the merit of testing a spinning \acrshort{pah} hypothesis, while noting that spinning nanosilicates, or even magnetic dipole emission from dust have also been put forth in the literature.

  In Ch.~\ref{ch:datasources}, we overviewed a collection of infrared all-sky surveys that help us prove the dust \acrshort{sed} from the UIR band range to the FIR, and discussed how these could help explore the \acrshort{ame} question. We described also complimentary data and parameter maps from the Planck Collaboration that can be compared with the IR maps. Particular advantages of the \acrshort{pah} tracing bands, especially the A9 band, for covering not only neutral but potentially charged \acrshort{pah}s, were discussed in the context of \acrshort{ame} investigation. Limitations were given for all of these data sets--- most of these boiling-down to component separation either of the Zodical light from thermal dust emission, or to the latter from other microwave foregrounds and the CMB.

  In Ch.~\ref{ch:lori} we combined and processed the data presented in Ch~\ref{ch:datsources} to investigate a particular region of the sky with relatively high S/N in all of the data, and demonstrating strong \acrshort{ame}. We evaluated the background, noise, and contamination from systematic errors and point sources in these data, and compared them on a common resolution and grid. All of the analyses from simple correlation plots, to bootstrap analysis, to dust \acrshort{sed} fitting suggest that A9 emisison correlates with \acrshort{ame} better than I12 or D12- supporting \acrshort{pah} emisison as the source of \acrshort{ame}, and suggesting the role of charged \acrshort{pah}s should be further explored. In addition we find that the bands near the thermal dust emisison peak show a weaker correlation, perhaps suggesting that harsh radiation fields may be destroying \acrshort{pah}s, leading to weaker \acrshort{ame}. We also cautioned that although \acrshort{pah} mass correlates better than dust mass, we still see a good correlation between FIR emisison and \acrshort{ame} (P545, P857). This raises the possibility that \acrshort{ame}, \acrshort{pah}s, and cold dust are all correlated.

  In Ch.~\ref{ch:allsky} we attempted to find evidence that the result from Ch.~\ref{ch:datasources} applies even when looking at a less region-specific scale, using an all-sky analysis. However neither the full-sky unmasked case, or the case employing a mask of low S/N regions (mainly high galactic latitudes), point sources, and the galactic plane, showed a stronger correlation between \acrshort{pah} related emission and \acrshort{ame} than that seen between FIR emission and the \acrshort{ame}. We did however find that as in Ch.~\ref{ch:lori}, A9 tends to correlate with \acrshort{ame} better than I12 or D12. We discussed apparent systemtic issues with the \acrshort{ame} data, such as the possibility for under or over subtraction of free-free or synchrotron emission, and how these could serve to weaken evidence of any \acrshort{pah} or small grain correlation wiht the \acrshort{ame}. Scaling the infrared intensities by $U$ does not change this result. We reproduce the result from \cite{hensley16} that there is not an overall correlation between \acrshort{pah} fraction and \acrshort{ame}-per-dust-emisison, but expand this calculation showing that for a few limited regions on the sky there may be evidence of a correlation. We discuss how a potential variation on the optical thickness between UIR bands, FIR emisison, among other factors, could lead do a different result between $\lambda$~Orionis and the all-sky analysis. We also discuss potential observional advances that could help explore the issue further.

  Overall, using the presently available data, it is difficult to isolate the \acrshort{pah}-dust relationship, from the dust-AME relationship. We find throughout this work that a \acrshort{pah}-emission to \acrshort{ame} correlation is readily demonstable, in intensity. A test of whether a second-order relationship exists, such that \acrshort{pah} emission is a better predictor of the \acrshort{ame} than thermal dust emission, was shown to be inconclusive. One exception is that of $\lambda$~Orionis, where our results suggest that \acrshort{pah} mass correlates better with \acrshort{ame} than does the total dust mass. Nevertheless we emphasize this point cautiously, because we were not able to generalize it to a larger scale (all-sky data with, effectively, a mask on the galactic plane and high latitude emission.)  We are not able to confirm or reject a ``spinning \acrshort{pah}'' hypothesis for the source of \acrshort{ame}. However in $\lambda$~Orionis, and perhaps other regions yet to be examined in with dust \acrshort{sed} fitting, we suggest that there is still ample reason to continue testing this hypothesis.
