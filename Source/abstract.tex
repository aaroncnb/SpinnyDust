The anomalous microwave emission (AME) still lacks a coherent explanation. lectric dipole emission by rapidly rotating dust (``spinning dust'') and magnetic dipole emission by grains with magnetic inclusions (``magnetic dust'') have emerged as potential explanations. We explore the scenario in which spinning polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules (PAHs) are the dominant carriers of the AME. We use data from the AKARI/Infrared Camera (IRC), due to its thorough PAH-band coverage, to compare AME (Planck Coll. astrophysical component separation product) with infrared dust emission. The results and discussion contained here apply to an angular scale of approximately 1$^{\circ}$. In general, our results support an AME-from-dust hypothesis. At 1$^{\circ}$ angular resolution, we do not find evidence that the AME is exclusively carried by PAHs. The correlation of far IR dust emission with AME appears to be the best predictor, with MIR/PAH emission being marginally more weakly correlated with AME. In the case of lambda Orionis, AME vs. PAH is at least as strong as AME vs. FIR. Higher resolution studies will be needed in the future to fully solve the AME mystery. re consistent with previous studies in that the AME has a clear connection to interstellar dust, but a conclusive link to any particular population of dust is unapparent.
