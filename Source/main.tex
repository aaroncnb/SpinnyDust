\begin{abstract}
%The anomalous microwave emission (AME) still lacks a coherent explanation. Both electric dipole emission by rapidly rotating dust (``spinning dust") and magnetic dipole emission by grains with magnetic inclusions (``magnetic dust") have emerged as theoretically plausible explanations. We explore the spinning dust angle. Specifically, the particular scenario in which spinning polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules (PAHs) are the dominant carriers of the AME. We use AKARI/Infrared Camera (IRC), due to its thorough PAH-band coverage, to analyze 98 regions showing evidence of AME. Also in the mid-infrared, we include the PAH-tracing bands of IRAS, WISE, and DIRBE (around 12 microns), for comparison to the pre-release IRC data. We supplement the MIR data with AKARI Far Infrared Surveyor (FIS), and Planck High Frequency Instrument (HFI) bands at 857 and 545~GHz, and IRAS to constrain the full dust thermal spectral energy distribution (SED). We carry out a dust SED fitting and find no preferential relationship between estimates of PAH abundance and the AME. At best, they PAH-dominated bands correlate with AME as well as the band s tracing the peak thermal dust emission. The results are consistent with previous studies in that the AME has a clear connection to interstellar dust, but a conclusive link to any particular population of dust is unapparent.

\section{Introduction}

     Since its first detection in early microwave surveys , the anomalous microwave emission/foreground (AME) has been found to be a widespread feature of the microwave Milky Way \citep{dickinson13r}. \cite{kogut96,deoliveiracosta97,leitch98} showed that the AME correlates very well with infrared emission from dust, via COBE/DIRBE and IRAS far-IR maps. However there is still much mystery, except that the most likely source of the AME is interstellar dust \citep{ysard10a,tibbs11,hensley16}.

 From the observed spatial correlation between AME and dust emerged two prevailing hypotheses:

 1) Electric dipole emission by spinning small dust grains, a mechanism proposed in \cite{erickson57} and \cite{hoyle70}, with further discussion in \cite{ferrara94}. \cite{draine98b} give the earliest thorough description, with substantial updates contributed more recently by \cite{ysard10a}, \cite{ali-haimoud09}, \cite{hoang10} and several others. \cite{dickinson13r} provide a detailed overview of AME and spinning dust literature.

 2) Magnetic dipole emission, caused by thermal fluctuations in grains with magnetic inclusions, proposed by \cite{draine99}.

 More recently, modeled spectra for potential candidate carriers have appeared in the literature: PAHs, grains with magnetic inclusions \citep{draine13, ali-haimoud14, hoang16a}.

A third, but not widely accepted, possible explanation for AME is discussed in \cite{jones09}. They have suggested that the emissivity of dust, in the spectral range related to AME, could contain features caused by low temperature solid-state structural transitions.


     Although spinning dust need not be the only emission mechanism, the photometric signature of the AME, has so far been commonly explained via spinning dust parameters \citep{ysard11,ali-haimoud10}. In this paper, we explore the case that the AME signature arises from spinning dust emission. If the AME is carried by spinning dust, the most likely candidate that has been proposed so far is the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon family of molecules (PAHs). PAHs are hydrocarbons based on fused carbon rings. Those PAHs which have a permanent electric dipole (i.e. coranulene, but not symmetric molecules like coronene), can emit rotationally.

     The mid-infrared ``PAH features" are ubiquitous in the ISM \citep{giard94,onaka96,onaka00}, such that the carriers must be abundant. There has not yet been a conclusive identification of any particular PAH species. However \cite{andrews15} strongly argue for the  existence of a dominant ``grandPAH'' class, containing 20 to 30 PAH species.

     Assuming a rotational emission model, the AME signature (consistent with continuum emission having a peak around 20 to 40~GHz ) implies very small oscillators (\textasciitilde{}10~nm). In any case, the PAH class of molecules are the only spinning dust candidate so far which show both: 1) Evidence of abundance in the ISM at IR wavelengths, and 2) A predicted range of dipole moments (on order of 1~debye), to produce the observed AME signature \citep{draine98b, lovas05, thorwirth07}. However, it should be noted that the current upper-bound on the abundance of nanosilicates, allows for a "spinning nanosilicate" explanation for the AME, as shown by \cite{hensley17a}. Due to the (apparently) continuous shape of the AME SED, a distribution of dipole moments and rotational velocities is needed, in a spinning dust scenario.

AKARI/IRC 9~$\mu$m, IRAS 12~$\mu$m, WISE 12~$\mu$m bands are dominated by PAH emission (see Figure \ref{fig:inband_ionfrac_bar}. The AKARI 18~$\mu$m, and  IRAS 25~$\mu$m bands contain minimal PAH emission. }

%\end{figure*}



    The overall pattern among large-scale studies seems to show that all of the dust-tracing photometric bands show evidence of at least a first-order correlation with the AME (and each other.) On an all-sky, pixel-by-pixel basis, at 1-degree angular resolution, \cite{ysard10b} find that 12~$\mu$m emission, via IRAS, correlates more strongly with AME (via WMAP) than with 100~$\mu$m emission. They also find that scaling the IR intensity by the interstellar radiation field strength (given as $G_0$, a measure of ISRF relative to that of the solar neighborhood) improves both correlations.

    However in a similar work, \cite{hensley16} report that the 12~$\mu$m emission (via WISE) correlates less tightly with AME than with thermal dust radiance, using the Planck Collaboration dust and AME component-separation maps \citep{planck15X}. Also at odds with \cite{ysard10b}, they report that AME correlates more strongly with 12~$\mu$m intensity than with the intensity scaled by the interstellar radiation field.

     The story is no more clear when looking at the average properties of individual regions. \cite{planckXV} find that among 22 high-confidence ''AME regions" (galactic clouds such as the $\rho$~Ophiuchus cloud and the Perseus molecular cloud complex) AME vs. 12~$\mu$m  shows a marginally weaker correlation than AME vs. 100~$\mu$m (via IRAS).

     In this work, we attempt to reach some stronger consensus on the large-scale AME vs. IR-dust story. In Section \ref{sec:data}, we describe the all-sky surveys and component maps used in this paper. The sources range from PAH-domianted MIR bands from AKARI and IRAS to FIR and microwave-derived maps from Planck Observatory. These bands are listed in table \ref{sec:data}, and are outlined in the following Data section. Section  \ref{sec:analysis} describes our investigation approach: looking at all-sky trends, a circular aperture photometry on a list of regions of interest, and a localized study of the AME region of largest angular size, lambda Orionis. Section \ref{sec:discussion} describes the conclusions of these 3 approaches, and compares them to previous AME vs. dust emission studies.

  .

    We utilize the newly created AKARI/IRC 9~$\mu$m all-sky map, which more completely covers PAH features than previous all-sky surveys, and has the highest fractional contribution from PAH emission, as can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:inband_ionfrac_bar}, assuming a PAH and grain SED model such as \cite{draine01}. This is especially true as the interstellar radiation field (ISRF) intensifies, and the IRAS or WISE 12~$\mu$m bands include more continuum emission.


\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}

This work relies completely on all-sky surveys. All of the maps utilized are photometric-band infrared maps, except for the AME data, which is an all-sky component separation analysis product, from the Planck Collaboration's efforts to separate galactic foregrounds from the CMB.

We are primarily interested in the AKARI/IRC 9~$\mu$m band's unique coverage of the PAH bands at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.2~$\mu$m, and if this shows any stronger/weaker correlation with AME than the WISE or IRAS 12~$\mu$m bands. In total, we use all-sky maps from 19 photometric bands, spanning the wavelength range of 6.9~$\mu$m to 550~$\mu$m***

\subsection{Infrared Data}

     The AKARI infrared space telescope revealed an entire sky of infrared light, from the mid to far infrared, via two instruments \citep{akari07} the Infrared Camera (IRC)\citep{irc07} and the Far Infrared Surveyor (FIS) \citep{fis07}.

     IRC's 9~$\mu$m band all-sky map demonstrates the abundance of the PAH bands carrier in the Milky Way \citep{ishihara10}. This band uniquely covers major ionized PAH features at 6.2 and 7.7~$\mu$m; as well as neutral PAH features at 8.6 and 11.2~$\mu$m across the entire sky, in a single photometric band \citep{irc07}. The IRAS 12~$\mu$m band covers the 11.2 and 8.6~$\mu$m features, and the similarly-shaped WISE~12~$\mu$m band covers primarily the 11.2~$\mu$m feature. According to this distribution of PAH features across the response filters, it is expected that the IRC 9~$\mu$m band is the one most dominated by PAH emission. This is especially in the case of ionized PAHs, since the IRAS and WISE bands do not strongly cover the ionized PAH features.

      We utilize the most recent version of the IRC data (Ishihara, et al., in prep.) This version has had an updated model of the Zodiacal light, fitted and subtracted. The details of the improved Zodi-model, which offers an improvement over that used for the IRAS all-sky maps, are given in \cite{kondo16}.

    The AKARI Far Infrared Surveyor (FIS) gives us photometric data around the peak of the typical thermal dust SED. FIS was equipped with four wavebands: two narrow bands centered at 65~$\mu$m and at 160~$\mu$m, and two wide bands at 90~$\mu$m and at 140~$\mu$m. An all-sky survey was carried out at each band \citep{kawada07}, and the processed maps have been publicly released \citep{doi15}.

     The Planck Space Observatory (Planck) High Frequency Instrument (HFI) all-sky maps, spanning 100 to 857~GHz \citep{hfi14viii} constrain the far IR dust emissivity. This study utilizes the 857~GHz (345~$\mu$m) and 545~GHz (550~$\mu$m) bands.

     Data from the Infrared Astronomical Satellite \citep{iras84} all-sky surveys are used to supplement the similarly-centered AKARI photometric bands. The IRAS 12~$\mu$m band is similar to the AKARI 9~$\mu$m band in terms of the sky coverage, central wavelength, and especially in that both surveys are heavily dominated by zodiacal light. We use the Improved Reprocessing of the IRAS Surveys (IRIS) \citep{iris05}, which use undergone a zodiacal-light removal. The Zodiacal light model, however differs between the two bands. The IRAS Zodi-subtraction is primarily based on the \cite{kelsall98} model.

\subsection{AME Data}
     We utilize the AME component separation map, from the Planck Collaboration's Public Data Release 2. Details of the foreground contribution estimates are given in \cite{planckXII}. We caution readers that this AME map was created primarily for the purpose of isolating the CMB from galactic microwave emission. It is not to be taken as a perfect isolation of the AME. We employ it in this work, simply because there is no other all-sky AME estimate available. We also quote AME estimates for 98 circular apertures, found in \cite{planckXV}, that were made using a more careful region-by-region component separation method.

\subsection{All-sky Data Processing}

      The HFI, FIS, and IRIS maps used here are downloaded from their respective online repositories, as all-sky HEALPix \citep{gorski15} NSIDE 2048 maps. In the case of the IRC maps, we first create HEALPix maps from the 4,857 all-sky survey tiles using the Aladin all-sky data visualization platform \citep{bonnarel00}. NSIDE 2048 implies an average pixel spacing of 1.7$'$. The maps are then degraded to NSIDE 1024 before carrying out the Gaussian-beam smoothing to a 1-degree FWHM. Following the smoothing process, the maps are degraded once more to NSIDE 256. The value of each of the larger NSIDE 256 pixels, comes from the mean of its parent NSIDE 1024 pixels. The purpose of this processing is to ensure that all of the maps have the same resolution as the PR2 AME map.


\section{Analysis}
\label{sec:analysis}

The analysis we have done so far is done from 3 perspectives, but with all 3 relying on 1-degree resolution, Planck-based AME data. We start from a vary widely cast net: an AME to IR comparison on an all-sky basis, looking at trends among, essentially, all pixels in the all-sky maps (with an ecliptic plane mask.) Then we move to a slightly more regionalized comparison, looking at the set of AME-prominent galactic clouds identified by the \cite{planckXV} (wherein we keep our analysis parallel to theirs, to maintain comparability between their IRAS-Planck based result, and our result which adds-in AKARI data and dust SED fitting.) Lastly, we highlight a particular AME-dominated region, the ``Meissa ring'', otherwise known as the $\lambda$ Orionis molecular ring \citep{maddalena86,maddalena87}. Our hope is to highlight the limitations of low resolution AME data, at 3 different scales, and help to encourage the community to move to higher resolution, more localized, structural studies of AME and spinning dust.

\subsection{All-sky Pixel Domain Analysis}

	In order to look more closely at the variations between the individual bands' maps, we also include a pixel-by-pixel analysis. Figure \ref{fig:AMEvsDust_allsky_allbands} shows the result of such a comparison, for each of the 19 bands sampled. The AME data comes from the AME component map provided in the Planck Public Release 2, produced by the COMMANDER component separation method.

    To keep our analysis comparable to previous works, we carry-out the analysis by excluding pixels within 10 degrees of the ecliptic plane, where the Zodi-residuals can be a problem (especially in the MIR.) The remaining pixels are divided into ``high galactic latitudes" (more than 10 degrees from the galactic plane), and "low to mid galactic latitudes" (within 10 degrees of the plane).  While it is true that the story of pixels close to the plane tends to be complicated, it is also true that at high galactic latitudes, where IR dust emission is fainter, Zodi-subtraction uncertainties become more significant.

    We can quickly see that, for all of the bands, there is a first-order correlation between the IR with the AME. Figure \ref{fig:AME_IR_crosscorr_allbandsg} visualizes the cross-correlation matrix for each of the IR bands and the AME.

    Even excluding pixels near the ecliptic plane, and separating the sky into two GLAT ranges, the situation is very difficult to interpret. To understand if the same pattern persists across the sky rather than presenting only for the all-sky average, we repeat the correlation analysis for GLAT bins. For each degree of galactic latitude, we cross correlate that Planck modified blackbody fitting results vs. the AME and the AKARI 9 micron intensity. This type of analysis helps clarify the AME vs. FIR and MIR picture, but comes with the caveat that the galactic plane is much more heavily sampled than the galactic poles. Figure \ref{fig:PlanckModBBvsAMEandA9_byGLAT} shows the result of such analysis: For each 1-degree of galactic latitude, the Spearman rank correlation coefficient of AME vs. each of dust temperature, emissivity index Beta, total dust radiance, and AKARI 9 micron brightness is plotted.

Plots on the top row are based on the Spearman rank correlation test. Those on the bottom are based on the Pearson correlation coefficients. With either test, the AME does not show a strong correlation with other bands at high latitudes. At lower latitudes, the FIR bands show stronger correlation for the Pearson test, but there appears to be an even correlation across all bands in the case of the Spearman rank test. The AKARI 9 micron bands, and the other PAH-tracing bands show a stronger correlation only relative to the bands from 18 to 60 microns. The WISE 12 micron band is show for comparison purposes, but the version of the WISE 12 micron map used here has been produced only for visualization purposes and is not yet vetted for scientific analysis. }

\subsection{Analysis of Planck Collaboration AME Candidate Regions}

     Previously, \cite{planckXV} (hereafter, PCXV) had identified and analyzed a list of regions where the AME appeared to stand out, relative to estimates of known microwave foregrounds. The full set includes 98 regions. While the majority of these regions showed only low significance AME, or a high potential contribution from free-free emission, 27 of showed highly significant AME. We re-examined the full set of 98 regions, employing data from 19 photometric bands, from the AKARI, Planck, IRAS, and WISE data sets. The major goals are 1) To see how the AME to IR comparison looks with the AKARI data, and 2) To apply a dust SED fitting analysis to these regions. While tackling these goals, we attempted to keep our analysis is comparable as possible to the PCXV analysis by following their circular aperture photometry scheme. The process can be summarize as follows:

     1) For each region, the total flux within a 1 degree radius circular aperture is summed.

     2) A background annulus, with inner radius 80$'$ and outer radius 100$'$, is placed around the source aperture. The median value of pixels inside the annulus is taken, and then scaled up to solid angle of the central source aperture. This is used as background level, to be subtracted from the source flux.

     3) The noise level is estimated from the standard deviation of the background annulus pixels (estimating the noise level of large regions such as these is not a straightforward task.) We should note that for a few regions, the photometry done here using the PR2 map, and the photometry done on the same regions in PCXV, show discrepancies in the total flux measured (see Figure \ref{fig:AME_PCXVvsPR2}). These discrepancies do not alter our conclusions.

     Once photometry results were gathered for all of the 98 regions, we then performed a full dust SED fitting,

The SED of the different fields were fit using the \cite{galliano11} dust model. We used the amorphous carbon and silicate dust mixture. Indeed, this dust mixture is more emissive than the standard silicate-graphite \citep{draine07}, by a factor of 2-3. As was shown by Herschel, in the LMC \citep{galliano11}, and by Planck, in the Milky Way \citep{planck16}, this increase of emissivity is necessary to have a proper fit of the sub-mm emission. We assume that the radiation field heating this dust mixture is the Galactic ISRF \citep{math83}, scaled by a factor U. We also assume, following \cite{dale01}, that the dust is exposed to a distribution of starlight intensity, distributed as:

%\begin{equation}
     $dM_{dust}$ / U dU between $U_{min}$ and $U_{max}$; (1)
%\end{equation}

where $U_{min}$, $U_{max}$ and  are free parameters. An old stellar population template (PEGASE; \citep{fioc97}) is added to this SED in order to model the near-IR emission. We perform, for the moment, a simple least-squares analysis. The results of the SED fitting vs. the AME are shown in Figure \ref{fig:AME_regs_J13}. For the vast majority of the samples, the fits are reasonable, with the $\chi^{2}$ distribution (see Fig. \ref{fig:AME_PCXVvsPR2}) appearing as we expect.

     Two comparisons are shown - AME vs. PAH mass and AME vs. total dust mass, for two different AME data sets. The AME (PR2) data indicates the results of this work (our own photometry on the publicly available Planck 'COMMANDER' algorithm based AME map.) The AME (PCXV) plots, on the bottom, indicate that the AME flux values are those quoted from the PCXV analysis (wherein component separation, of AME from known foregrounds, was done region-by-region.) Furthermore, the regions themselves are categorized as high (red circles) or low (blue circles) significance AME. Simply based on Figure \ref{fig:AME_regs_J13}, it is difficult to discern a difference on the correlation strengths. To statistically evaluate the situation, we employ a Bootstrap re-sampling approach, re-running the Spearman rank correlation test for each of 100,000 random re-samples. The results of the Bootstrap analysis are given in Figure \ref{fig:AME_boostrap_mass_regs_all}. The distributions of correlation coefficients for AME vs. PAH mass, and AME vs. total dust mass., appear to be distinct. Mean correlation coefficients are separated by ~0.1+/-0.05-0.07.

%     If anything, the correlation tests indicate that the regions most reliably identified as AME-prominent, had a weaker correlation with both dust mass and with PAH mass. However, here we must be very cautious, considering the lower sample size of highly significant AME regions. Moreover, the difficulties in noise estimates, and the inherent uncertainty in the AME component separation process.

\subsection{Analysis of the $\lambda$~Orionis Region}

	Having looked at the AME vs. dust emission story on a very course scale, we now introduce our analysis of a particular region. The $\lambda$~Orionis molecular ring, shown in Figure \ref{fig:orionis-akari9} as it appears in 1-degree smoothed AKARI 9~$\mu$m data, indicates excess microwave emission attributed to AME \citep{planck15XXV}. At approx. 10 degrees wide, we can see the outline of the structure even in the low (1 degree FWHM) resolution Planck-COMMANDER AME map. This is one of the only structures on the sky with a relatively well-distinguished shape at such low resolution. In order to shift towards an investigation of individual AME-prominent regions, we have carried out an initial comparison of the AME of this region with its mid to far-IR dust emission.

	Figure \ref{fig:orionis-img} shows how the region looks, for 12 different photometric bands, from the mid to far IR. The contours show the region's structure as given by the Planck PR2 AME map. Figure \ref{fig:orionis-corr} shows simple IR to AME cross correlation plots, for all pixels within the 10 by 10 degree $\lambda$~Orionis region. Our findings for lambda $\lambda$~Orionis indicate an AME-PAH correlation, but we are unable to argue for a causal link.

\section{Discussion}
  \label{sec:Discussion}
         As noted in Section 1, previous studies found that the AME generally correlates at dust-related IR wavelengths \citep{ysard10b,planckXV, hensley16}. We see the same overall pattern in the present study, for each of the three scales examined: the all-sky pixel-based analysis, the re-examination of Planck AME Candidate regions, and the inspection of the $\lambda$~Orionis region.
         In the case of the AME candidate regions, do we find evidence of a statistically stronger relationship between AME and total dust mass than AME vs. PAH mass, for the full set of 98 regions. We were able to confirm that the correlation coefficients are statistically distinct, via boostrap re-sampling (with replacement.) However the difference is marginal. Moreover the full set of 98 regions includes many regions that are either near the galactic plane, or do not have a strong S/N for the AME component separation. A similar result is found when we compare AME to the total dust luminosity and PAH luminosity.

	The closeness of the correlation coefficients found here is consistent with the results of the IRAS vs. AME correlation test result from \cite{planckXV}. They found that correlation coefficient among the 4 IRAS bands (12, 25, 60, and 100 microns) differ from one another only by about 5\%, across the whole set of 98 regions. The trend of AKARI MIR and FIR data vs. the AME does not disagree with their IRAS comparison. This work adds that bands longer than IRAS 100 micron also correlate strongly with AME, especially the two Planck/HFI bands used.


         In the case of $\lambda$~Orionis, we do not apply a dust SED fitting, but we did find that the AKARI 9 micron emission and the longest wavelength Planck 545 GHz emission had the strongest Spearman rank correlation coefficients (0.80 and 0.81.) The literature does not yet contain a comparable analysis of AME in $\lambda$~Orionis, however if we consider the 9 micron band to be a tracer of PAH , emission, and Planck 545 Ghz band to be a tracer of thermal dust emission, the result is in-line with what we have seen in \cite{ysard10b} and \cite{hensley16}. In those works, the two relationships (MIR vs. AME and FIR vs. AME) are very close (although these two papers are odds as to which relationship is stronger, and in their final interpretation.) In the future, we will apply the same dust SED fitting analysis, and bootstrap verification as was applied to the AME candidate regions described above. We will also attempt our own fitting of the AME component, based on low frequency data (rather than using the "COMMANDER" AME map.)

       In our all-sky, pixel-by-pixel comparison, we find that all of the 19 wavelengths sampled show a first-order correlation with the AME. This is again consistent with the previous investigations of the AME cited above, wherein the only differences found are minor. Without applying further dust SED fitting, this analysis seems to concur with \cite{hensley16} in that the FIR bands (in their work, they used the dust radiance) show the tightest correlation. However, the difference in correlation from the MIR to FIR becomes very small when focusing only on galactic latitudes within 5 degrees of the plane. In \cite{hensley16}, the galactic plane is masked, whereas we mask only the pixels which have missing data from any of the 19 maps, as well as pixels within 10 degrees of the ecliptic plane (due to residual zodiacal light emission in the MIR maps.)

     From these results, we cannot confirm or rule out a spinning-PAH hypothesis on an all-sky, 1-degree scale. However, in  $\lambda$~Orionis, the results may be consistent with a scenario in which PAH mass, cold dust, and the AME are all tightly correlated. Weaker correlation from 25 to 70 microns may indicate that AME is weaker in regions of warmer dust and stronger radiation fields. Further analysis is needed to investigate if the AME seen in this region really comes from PAHs or other small spinning grains, and/or another source entirely.  Future work should investigate whether or not PAHs are being destroyed in the region of $\lambda$~Orionis where AME is weaker.

           We look forward to continued environment-resolved comparisons to investigate the potential AME-PAH relationship in a region by region manner. We will explore $\lambda$~Orionis in more detail, in a later paper. We will also employ higher resolution AME all-sky data as it becomes available.

%       The PAH-dominated bands (AKARI 9, IRAS 12) correlate with AME, but so do the thermal emission-dominated bands like AKARI~160 and Planck~550 (Figure \ref{fig:all-sky}, Figure \ref{fig:AME_IR_crosscorr_allbandsg}. The WISE 12 micron band was also included, and shows less scatter in the AME vs. IR plot than the other MIR bands.
%       What we add to the literature is a simple confirmation that this correlation is present in the AKARI bands. We recommend revisiting the all-sky pixel-by-pixel investigation if/when a finer resolution AME all-sky map can be produced. Such a map may be able to be produced upon completion of projects such as the the C-Band All-Sky Survey (C-BASS) by \cite{irfan15}, which maps the sky at higher resolution than the \cite{haslam82} 408~MHz survey. Currently, synchrotron component separation based on \cite{haslam82} limits the all-sky AME component separation to a resolution of about one degree.

%       In the case of the AME candidate regions, even though we carry out a more detailed analysis than with the all-sky case, essentially the same conclusion appears. The dust SED fitting shows that both the estimated PAH-mass per region, and the total dust mass per region correlate with the total AME flux per region.

%       The one possible exception, among the results shown here, is with $\lambda$~Orionis. Although we do again see the general correlation between dust emission and AME, where also note that the correlation weakens significantly between 25 and 160~$\mu$m. We interpret this early result as regions of warmer dust exhibiting weaker AME. A stronger correlation at the PAH-dominated bands as well as the longest wavelength bands might indicate a scenario in which AME is produced by PAHs, and that the PAH distribution follows that of the colder dust. However we feel that a more detailed analysis is needed to truly say that PAHs produce the AME seen in $\lambda$~Orionis, and to assess whether or not warm dust is truly the cause for the weaker AME seen inside the ring structure. In a future study we carry-out a pixel by pixel dust characterization, using an SED fitting similar to that described in Section 3.2.

%       We argue that a conclusion about the role (or lack thereof) of PAHs in producing the AME, is unlikely to be revealed, photometrically, without improved resolution.
